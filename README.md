# myapp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The main feature is the ability to translate text from any application on your Android device.

Hereâ€™s how you can use it:

Open any app on your Android device or emulator that contains text. This could be a web browser, a messaging app, or a notes app.
Select the text you want to translate by long-pressing on it.
From the context menu that appears (which usually shows options like "Copy", "Share", etc.), tap on "Translate".
The Translation Screen will appear, showing:
The original English text you selected.
A dropdown menu to choose a target Indian language (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, or Telugu).
The translated text. The first translation will be to Hindi by default.
A "Copy" button to copy the translated text to your clipboard.
If you open the "Text Translator" app directly from your app drawer, you will see a home screen that provides these same instructions.

I've also included a theme toggle in the main app, so you can switch between light and dark modes to suit your preference. Enjoy using your new translation tool
